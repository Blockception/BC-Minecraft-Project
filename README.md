A Typescript library for dealing with minecraft bedrock project data

## Examples

```ts
let project = MCProject.loadSync("some folder");

//First way of getting data
let tags = project.definitions.tag;
if (tags && tags.defined.includes('target')) {
  ...
}

//Second way of getting data
let tag = MCDefinition.getOrAdd(project.definitions, "tag");
if (tag.defined.includes("target")) {
  ...
}

//First way of getting project attribute
if (project.attributes.diagnose === "true") {
  ...
}

//Second way of gettin project attribute
if (MCAttributes.getOrAdd(project.attributes, "diagnose", "false") === "true") {
  ...
}

```

## Project Attribute

This standard will introduce 3 new file that will help with project definition, attributes, excluded/includes of folders/files and settings that deal with project for minecraft
bedrock.  
The file can be found in the root of the project. The following files will be added:

- [Blockception Minecraft Project](#blockception-minecraft-project)
  - [Examples](#examples)
  - [Project Attribute](#project-attribute)
    - [McAttributes](#mcattributes)
    - [McDefinitions](#mcdefinitions)
    - [McIgnore](#mcignore)

### McAttributes

The file with the name: `.mcattributes`. This file stores any of the settings or attribtues related to the project. Which uses universal determined keys along each project. Each
tool/program may also introduce each own set of keys, aslong as they are unique to the tool/program. Other programs/tools simply ignore these keys. But when overwriting the file,
must keep the old keys from other tools or programs.

A wider specification can be found in [McAttributes](https://faq.blockception.dev/mcproject/mcattributes)

**Example**

```ini
diagnose=true
diagnose.objectives=true
diagnose.tags=true
diagnose.mcfunctions=true

world.area_used=0 0 0 1000 256 1000
```

---

### McDefinitions

This file specifies anything that is included in the project, but cannot be found in the project files itself, or not easly. At the same time the user can also blacklist definition
through this same project.

A wider specification can be found in [McDefinitions](https://faq.blockception.dev/mcproject/mcdefinitions)

**Example**

```ini
## I am a comment

## Tags used in the map
tag=initialized
tag=calculating
tag=enemy
tag=monster

## Tags to be black listed
tag=!Monster

## Objectives used in the map
objective=var
objective=coin
objective=foo

## Objectives blacklisted
objective=!Var
objective=!Coin

## Families
family=npc

## Families Blacklisted
family=!Npc

## Entity names
name=Steve

## Entity names blacklisted
name=!steve
```

---

### McIgnore

Based upon `.gitignore`. This file specifies through glob-patterns what files, folder to included/excluded from the project.

A wider specification can be found in [McIgnore](https://faq.blockception.dev/mcproject/mcignore)

**Example**

```ini
## This is a comment
## this will ignore the folders/file called Template
Template

## This will included file/folders that are in a folder called template and have the name and extension: settings.json
!Template/settings.json
```
